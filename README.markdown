# ViMediaManager #

ViMediaManager is my try at building a media manager mainly for Mac, since the Mac platform has been seriously lacking in this department.

**Requirements:**	Mac OS X 10.4 or later.

**Feature List:**

  * Manage your movies, TV shows & anime collections.
  * Download media metadata from [TheMovieDB.org](http://TheMovieDB.org "The Movie Database"), [TheTVDB.com](http://TheTVDB.com "The Television Database") & [AniDB.net](http://anidb.net "Anime Database").
  * Get Trailers, Posters, Fanart, Banners, ClearArt, Logo's and Thumbnails for your movies and series from [Youtube.com](http://Youtube.com "Youtube"), [TheMovieDB.org](http://TheMovieDB.org "The Movie Database"), [TheTVDB.com](http://TheTVDB.com "The Television Database") & [Fanart.tv](http://fanart.tv "Fanart Television").
  * Batch search for movies & television shows.
  * Batch folder renumber to match your movie and series titles.
  * It looks and runs natively on Mac OS X!

### F.A.Q.? ###

#### Can you fix this bug?
If you find a bug, let me know what you did to make it happens, and i’ll do my best to fix it.

#### Why doesn't it have this or that basic feature?
Well, i'm still in the early release stages and haven't even reached version 1.0 yet, so I haven't gotten around to adding everything yet.  
You can let me know what you’re missing, and I’ll see if I can add it in a future version.

#### Your app is not showing this or that movie in the list, what's up with that?
ViMediaManager actually needs a certain file structure to work with:

- Movies Folder:  
- - Movie Title Folder  
- - - Movie File  
- - Movie Title Folder  
- - - Movie File  

But don't worry, ViMediaManager can help you easily organize your movies this way through the Tools menu.

#### How do I do _this_ or _that_, how does it work?
Unfortunately I don't have a manual yet, so you'll have to try things out yourself for now.

#### Does your app show studio logo's?
Yes it does, but you'll have to download them separately from this thread: (or similar threads)

Once you've downloaded the logo's pack, put the pictures inside a folder named "Studios" in the same location as ViMediaManager or in the following path: '~/Library/Application Support/ViMediaManager/Studios/'.

    <ul>
      <li class="new"><span class="hot">HOT!</span> Added the television section! I won't mention all the details here, but a LOT of work has gone into making this section beautiful and functional, so you guys 'n gals better appreciate it. ;)</li>
      <li class="new">Added <u>Svenska</u> translation, courtesy of <i>Mikael "Aros" Lehmann</i>, thank you the hard work!</li>
      <li class="new">Added <u>German</u> translation, courtesy of <i>Efty Edge</i>, thank you for the hard work!</li>
      <li class="new">Added <u>French</u> translations, courtesy of <i>Yannick Rose</i>, thank you for the hard work!</li>
      <li class="new">ViMM now comes with a user manual, courtesy of Jim Worrall, thank you for the hard work!</li>
      <li class="new">Finally added the ability to automatically download trailers! which will download the first youtube trailer available.</li>
      <li class="new">Added recommendations from Rotten Tomatoes.</li>
      <li class="new">Added an option to choose weather to 'ask first', 'never' or 'always' remove existing images.</li>
      <li class="new">Added a menu option to mark a movie as watched, and with it the "cmd + T" option to do so quickly.</li>
      <li class="new">Made the 'Missing Items' results window A LOT better. (The previous version was meant for internal debugging.)</li>
      <li class="new">Added an option to download actor thumbs to the item's folders, and set thumb paths accordingly.</li>
      <li class="new">Now scrapes the FULL IMDb cast information in preference to TMDB cast information, and gets a full list of certifications for every country available.</li>
      <li class="new">Added separate movie file renaming pattern, and some extra tags available to movie names.</li>
      <li class="new">You can now sort by extra files's availability.</li>
      <li class="new">Added support for tags. ( <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Video_library_tags" target="_wiki">http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Video_library_tags</a> )</li>
      <li class="dif">Translated the PHP code with which I fetched PHP data to native code, hopefully speeding it up, and at the very least making the app no longer lock up for a moment when fetching data. This also makes it even easier for me to add stuff, like full cast scraping, and certifications for every country available on IMDb.</li>
      <li class="dif">Movie File information is now being looked up while it's writing the NFO file, rather then during the scraping process, it's a lot less error prone, and now home movies also have access to file information being saved upon saving data through the metadata editor.</li>
      <li class="dif">You can now choose a trailer before you download one when you select the 'download trailer' option from the menu's.</li>
      <li class="dif">You can now add sets with any name, not just with existing movie names.</li>
      <li class="dif">Added an optional extra line of information to the movie list, set it through the movie preferences.</li>
      <li class="dif">Stylised the recommendations list, and added different sections for recommendation sources.</li>
      <li class="dif">Stylised the sets manager while I was adding styles to the recommendations list.</li>
      <li class="dif">Added trailer URLs from hd-trailers.net.</li>
      <li class="dif">Caching poster images on refresh/reload list, so people won't have to manually scroll through the entire list to show poster images.</li>
      <li class="dif">Rebuild the search window so I can use it for both the movie and television section.</li>
      <li class="dif">Stopped fetching recommendations for YAMJ users, since it might wrongly think it needs to use the ID for instead.</li>
      <li class="dif">Clean now has an option to clean 'Other' files, as well as a more thorough image cleaning function.</li>
      <li class="dif">Tweaked the image picker scrolling settings to be less jumpy and react more predictably.</li>
      <li class="dif">Added Swedish database language to preferences.</li>
      <li class="fix">Added the '<playcount>1</playcount>' tag when marking a movie as watched, as otherwise XBMC won't read the <watched> flag, thanks to XBMC Developer 'Memphiz' for pointing this one out!</watched>
      <li class="fix">Fanart.TV decided to change locations.</li>
      <li class="fix">Fixed a bug where it would crash while trying to get recommendations.</li>
      <li class="fix">Many other minor, or not so minor bug fixes, changes and stability improvements.</li>
      <li class="fix">And anything else that I might have forgotten to add here.</li>

  <h3>Developer notes:</h3>

  <p>It's finally here, the moment all you television lovers have been waiting for!</p>
  <p>A fully functional television AND episodes manager! ViMM will finally download and write episode information.</p>
  <p>ViMediaManager can now keep track of the watched status of your entire series of episodes, wether you keep the files on disk or throw them away after watching as I do.</p>
  <p>But you can also see exactly how long, down to the minute, you'll have to wait for the next episodes of your favorite series to come on TV by sorting the TV list by 'Air Date'.</p>
  <p>A <b>LOT</b> of work has gone into making this section not just functional, but also fun to use!</p>
  <br/>
  <p><i>So, please enjoy! and let me know how you like it!</i></p>

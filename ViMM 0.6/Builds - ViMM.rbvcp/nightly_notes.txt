HELP WANTED!
If there are any web designers out there that read this, and are willing to help me out with a special ViMM project, please contact me at vimediamanager@gmail.com.



Doing a rebuild of the movie metadata fetching system, since it was kinda messy.
I think i'm finally getting auto trailer download to work! albeit without a sense of progress during the download, which is a pity, but since this is such an oft ask request, i'm not gonna let that stop me.

Also re-writing the art-grabbers, did you know that while FanartTV can has HD clearart on movies, ViMM cannot!? ridicules!

Also, I may be working on a little surprise, if it works out. ;)

Now looks up the movie file's information while it's writing the NFO rather then during the process of information scraping, and it's a lot less error prone.
As an added bonus, if you open up the metadata editor for a 'home' movie and save the information, file information is now also added.


## Latest update - 2012.12.17 T 01.25 GMT+1 ##

You can now set 'local' image paths for actor images, such as "/Users/YOURNAME/pictures/fred flintstones.jpg".
Also added an option to download actor images to an item's local folder in an 'actors' subfolder, and set the path inside the NFO file to the actor local image.
You will have to 'update' an item if you move it though, since actor images work with absolute shell paths.

Fixed a bug where it would remove episode cast information when updating an item.

EXPERIMENTAL: Added a "DarkUI" Preference Toggle under the 'Experimental' button.

Actually enabled saving in the tv shows metadata editor.

Still working on the episodes manager.
You can now see the local or internet thumb of an episode if available.
Season rows show the amount of episodes in that season.

Made a couple of changes to season art files, you've now got:
"season ##.jpg", "seasonbanner ##.jpg", "season ##-fanart.jpg", "season ##-landscape.jpg"
"specials.jpg",  "specialsbanner.jpg",   "specials-fanart.jpg", "specials-landscape.jpg"
"season-all.jpg", seasonbanner-all.jpg", "seasonall-fanart.jpg", "seasonall-landscape.jpg"

And these will be sorted in their season ## folders, the specials folder, or the tv show folder, if they exist, otherwise they all end up in the tv show folder.

You can view 'season' art by opening the episodes manager, and selecting either "Season ##", "Specials" or "All Episodes" for "Season ##", "Specials" and "All" art respectively.

Working on the episodes manager, it's gonna be awesome!

Also, added the tv sorting option 'sort by status', and sorting now actually works in the TV section.

Did more work on the metadata editor, it went surprisingly fast, well maybe not that surprising, since I did a fairly good job on building a solid, yet expandable foundation while building the movie section. ^^

Also, fixed IMDb recommendations, I accidentally used a different name while re-programming it to REALStudio BASIC then what it had in PHP.

Started working on the metadata editor, just note that it doesn't 'save' data yet.

Now scraping the FULL cast list from IMDb instead of getting a 'partial' cast list from TMDB, converting the PHP IMDb scraper to native REALStudio code to make my coding-life easier was a good decision.
Also scraping some other extras, like the full certification list, collecting all 'mpaa' ratings for different countries from IMDb.


## Latest update - 2012.12.07 T 23.10 GMT+1 ##

Alright, now you can download a single items' missing images, or 'ALL' missing images for TV Shows.


## Latest update - 2012.12.07 T 02.42 GMT+1 ##

I've been doing some work on image fetching, mainly 'manual' image fetching.
You can now use the 'extras' menu to download single pieces of extra art.
(The "Missing" and "All Images" don't work just yet.)

Also in place is an easy way for me to fetch art for specific seasons.

And as an added bonus, 'auto download season art' will now fetch banners and fanart files besides the good old poster and landscape files.
The season art files will be automatically downloaded into "Season ##" folders, when they're available, otherwise they'll download into the tv show folder.

More work on the episode guide and episode NFO fetching, the first time you fetch episodes for a tv show will be slow since it'll also try to fetch information from IMDb.

I could speed the process up a lot by going for just the TVDB data, missing out on IMDb Ratings and actor name/role/thumb information.
But on subsequent scrapes, it'll be faster again anyhow since it won't have to refetch information from IMDb for existing episodes.

Anyway, also added a 'rename pattern' field for episode files, and it'll work as follows:
If 'auto manage media' is enabled, episodes will be moved to 'season #' or 'specials' folders, and if renaming for 'folders & files' is enabled, episodes will be named according to the pattern settings in the preferences window.
If auto manage media is disabled, nothing of the above happens, as usual, just NFO files and thumb files will be downloaded in place where the episode file resides.

I improved the dialog that would show if, for example, you're scraping missing movies information.
It'll now show the movie poster and the message in a list of items, and includes a button to 'show' the item in the finder, which should be much more useful then plain text, which was actually meant for development & debugging.

And you can now 'update all' tv shows.

Transcoded the PHP files that fetched my IMDB information into native code, hopefully speeding it up, and at the very least it will no longer temporarily make the application go stuck while fetching information.

Added preliminary episode scraping support!

Did some more connecting TV show options to processes, so clicking the menu bottom below the TV list (or right-clicking) now actually make most of the menu items actually perform the proper actions.

I should also almost be done with episode scraping! ViMM is already pretty able at moving episode files into "Season #" And "Specials" folders, all that's left to do is to actually write the NFO file and download thumbnails.

I've been thinking with downloading episode guides, and the 'Process' dialog, let me know if functions suddenly stopped working, because i'll have forgotten to re-link them. ;)

Yay! I'm the Master of time! at least I hope so.
TV Shows should now show the correct time left until airtime, no matter where you live.
So the "Today" section should actually show shows that air 'today', even if today was 3AM.

You can also 'update all show status' through the file menu to update all show's status' all at once, all for you!

I've also put up little 'bookmarks' to show how many days until air time, but if anyone has better ideas to show off how much time/days is left, please send me your ideas!

I've also fixed a bug where it wouldn't actually download art from the TVDB while scraping for information.

Also, try out the 'fetch missing metadata' functions, but be warned, tvdb doesn't return on most likely correct hit i think, so there is a risk that it may download the wrong metadata if multiple results are found.


## 2012.11.28 T 01.20 GMT+1 ##

Most important update, I've added relative time until TV shows start, this is gonna be soo cool! it'll even 'count down' the hours before a show is aired in your native timezone.
First scrape a show to add the 'next aired date' to the show's metadata.
Please check if the GMT time is correct and report back to me!
// TODO: Pretty it up.

I've also added an 'other' option to the 'clean' feature, which should move all Miscellaneous files to the trash, that aren't part of the movie or extras, be careful with testing this one though.


## 2012.11.27 T 01.24 GMT+1 ##

The TV section can now "Fetch Metadata", which will fetch data from TheTVDB, IMDB & TVRage, and download images from TheTVDB & Fanart.TV.
